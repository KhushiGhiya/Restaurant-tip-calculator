Tip Calculator is a small web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br> It allows users to enter a bill amount, choose or input a custom tip percentage, and specify the number of people to split the bill. <br>
The app then calculates the tip amount, total bill including tip, and the amount each person needs to pay. <br> It features a simple, user-friendly interface with both preset tip options and a custom input field for flexibility.<br>
